    <h2>About EchoPad</h2>
    <p><b><i>EchoPad</i> </b>is a revolutionary smart notepad designed for the modern world. Combining the feel of traditional handwriting with cutting-edge technology, EchoPad allows you to jot down notes, sketches, or ideas just like on paper — but with a reusable surface. Whether you’re a student, professional, or creative thinker, EchoPad helps you stay organized while reducing paper waste and clutter.

What makes EchoPad truly special is its ability to sync your handwritten notes directly to the cloud. With support for services like Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox, your notes are safe, searchable, and always accessible from your devices. The built-in handwriting recognition feature (OCR) converts your handwritten notes to editable text, making it easier to share, edit, or archive your work.

Built for sustainability, EchoPad features a durable, eco-friendly design. The surface is engineered to be reusable up to 50,000 times, and the smart pen ensures smooth writing and easy erasing. With a slim, lightweight build and long-lasting battery life of up to 30 days on a single charge, EchoPad is the perfect companion for people on the go.

EchoPad comes with a companion mobile app that helps you organize, tag, and manage your notes effortlessly. The app also offers reminders, cloud backup options, and note-sharing features. Whether you’re brainstorming, taking class notes, or managing daily tasks, EchoPad makes note-taking smarter, greener, and simpler.
